<h1>Eva Programming Language</h1>

Eva: A Simple Interpreted Language with Lisp Dialect and JIT Compilation

Eva is a simple interpreted programming language with a Lisp dialect and JIT compilation. It includes features such as class functions, loops, and objects.

Getting Started

To get started with Eva, you can download the interpreter from the Eva website: https://www.evaair.com/. Once you have the interpreter installed, you can start writing Eva programs by creating a new file with the .eva extension.

Once you have written an Eva program, you can run it by passing the file name to the interpreter. For example, to run the file my_program.eva, you would use the following command:

eva my_program.eva
